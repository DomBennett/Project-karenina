# Additional analysis

_Aim:_

Determine whether birth-death models are able to recreate the observed EDt1~
EDt0 relationships.

_Method:_

* Simulate trees from ["Evolutionarily distinct “living fossils” require both lower speciation and lower extinction rates"](https://doi.org/10.1017/pab.2016.36).
* Scenarios are: pan, de, eph and pf
* Create EDt1~EDt0 graph for each of these simulation scenarios
