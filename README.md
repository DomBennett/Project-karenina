# How do living fossils arise?

## Introduction

Are all living fossils, living fossils for much the same reason, or is each
living fossil a living fossil for different reasons? Looking at the tree of
life today it is difficult to know how at an organism described as a living
fossil arose: is it the sole survivor of a once large radiation (an
evolutionary relict) or has it always been a living fossil -- a species that
evolves at a slower rate than other species. In Tolstoy's words, are living
fossils happy or unhappy?

To answer this question, we track the status of a living fossil through time
using a combination of molecular phylogenetics and fossil records. For
large species-level phylogenies we pin fossil records to the tree using a
stochastic process in order to recreate the phylogenetic tree at different time
points. We then retrace the living fossil status -- using evolutionary
distinctness (ED) as a proxy -- of species today in order to determine their
different histories.
